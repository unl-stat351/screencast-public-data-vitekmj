Things you plan to investigate using this dataset:

- TD Ratings by catergory
- TDs by state
- TD Timecontrol rating trends

Stat 351 topics you plan to cover during the analysis:

1. Webscraping 
2. Ethical API usage
3. EDA/LIST PROCESSING
4. Good use of graphics


I hope to be able to get the 3 time control ratings for players who are also TDs and then anaylze based on state and games played how they compare to other people and states based on percentiles.
